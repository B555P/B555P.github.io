## About Me
Greetings! My name is Ben Portz, and I am an accomplished Electro-Mechanical engineer with a proven track record of success in various industries. I am currently thriving in my role as an engineer at Williams Patent Crusher & Pulverizer, where I am currently leveraging my skills to support the installation of manufacturing material classification systems.

Prior to this, I gained valuable experience working as an Electro-Mechanical R&D engineer at Emerson Electric, where I was part of a multidisciplinary team focused on developing thermostatic expansion gas valves. Additionally, I had the opportunity to hone my project engineering skills while working in the chemical plant for agriculture at Bayer-Monsanto, contributing significantly to the successful completion of multiple projects.

My passion for engineering extends beyond my professional career. During my time as a research assistant at the University of Southern Illinois Edwardsville, I gained expertise in mechatronics while utilizing microcontrollers to help a user interface with a virtual "prosthetic limb".

I am happy to showcase the projects I have completed in my spare time, which are a testament to my commitment to innovation and engineering excellence. Please take a moment to explore the projects below, which I developed shortly before graduating from college a few years ago.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, and I look forward to discussing how my skills and experience can benefit your organization.

### Car traveling at 60 mph

The project below is a simplified geometry simulation from a set of tutorials I guest-lectured for a class of 15 SIUE students. The goal was to introduce the students to the capabilities of ANSYS Fluent. This simulation shows the velocity and pressure of flowing air passing over a fast-moving car traveling through a tunnel. The results of the simulation can be better refined by using a finer mesh, and increasing the resolution of the time step size.

### Electronics Thermal Packaging
This simulation was performed on SimScale and simulates the task of cooling down electronic packaging. This simulation explores the temperature, pressure, and velocity of the cooling air as it is sucked through the electronic housing.

### Scissor Lift (Rated for 1000 lbs.) 
The scissor lift is rated for a load of up to 1000 lbs with a factor of safety of (3.1). The scissor is completely mechanically driven with an ACME threaded rod located in the bottom base acting as the drive shaft.

### CPU Cooler Fan
This is a project that I am currently working on. It shows a CPU cooling fan placed upon a glazed, blue motherboard. The goal of the project is to measure the impact of design changes to the heat sink and fan velocity on the performance of the CPU cooler.

## Electrical Projects
### Transducer Circuit Schematic 
This project is the electronic design of a transducer circuit board that is powered with an input voltage of 12V. The layout, model, and documentation were prepared in the open-source software KIcad. The board is 1 sided to save on cost and does not include the zone layers to increase component visibility. The board is not fully complete as the sizing of the tracing needs to be calculated, and at this time at least two connections of the copper tracing need to be rerouted along with component U2 which needs to be replaced. These aspects will be fixed in version 2.

### Python and Academic Projects

### Linear Regression Curve_Fit App (Image Processing)  
This project involves image processing in python. The app imports in pixel colors from the graph data and identifies which pixels are relavent. After collecting the data the user can input in the function type that they feel best fits the graph. (Linear, Cubic, Polynomial, Exponential, or Logarithmic). The app then uses an approximation iteration method to find the best fitting function of that type.
