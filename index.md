### Car traveling at 60 mph

The project below is a simulation from a set of tutorials I guest-lectured for a class of 15 SIUE students. The goal was to introduce the students to the capabilities of ANSYS Fluent. This simulation shows the velocity and pressure of flowing air passing over a fast-moving car traveling through a tunnel.

### Electronics Thermal Packaging
This simulation was performed on SimScale and simulates the task of cooling down electronic packaging. This simulation explores the temperature, pressure, and velocity of the cooling air as it is sucked through the electronic housing.

### Scissor Lift (Rated for 1000 lbs.) 
The scissor lift is rated for a load of up to 1000 lbs with a factor of safety of (3.1). The scissor is completely mechanically driven with an ACME threaded rod located in the bottom base acting as the drive shaft.

### CPU Cooler Fan
This is a project that I am currently working on. It shows a CPU cooling fan placed upon a glazed, blue motherboard. The goal of the project is to measure the impact of design changes to the heat sink and fan velocity on the performance of the CPU cooler.
